# Whack A Mole

Whack A Mole Revamped, a simple clicker game created in Javascript. A slight spin off from the original Whack A Mole, more of a Whack A Plumber.

General concept of the game, is to click the plumbers as they pop up on the screen with your trustee Hammer themed mouse cursor. The game has a timer, some controls as well as a score.

### Features Left to Implement

- Additional/Multiple Levels

## Testing 

Testing was and is an ongoing process, this is primarily done due the development process. Typically one developer preferred chrome and the other firefox, this unintended method of work enabled us to catch some interesting errors before the game would reach any potential users. E.g. Chrome by default doesn't autoplay sound, where as firefox does. Originally music was to autoplay upon loading the site, chrome unintentionally broken this feature so a rework was required, this was fixed by using the play button for the game to also start the music. Chrome initially required user interaction on the page and autoplay settings to be enabled by the client, by starting the audio when the game is pressed resolved the issue and would then be part of the general gameplay loop regardless.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
